/**
 * Defines the metadata that is required for reading and rendering a Volumetric Depth Image (VDI).
 *
 * [version] The version of the VDI generation code. Used to prevent errors due to code version mismatch.
 * [index] The index of the VDI streamed in an ongoing VDI streaming session
 * [projection] The projection matrix of the camera used to generate the VDI.
 * [view] The view matrix of the camera used to generate the VDI.
 * [model] The model matrix of the volume in the scene for which the VDI was generated.
 * [volumeDimensions] The dimensions (in voxels) of the volume on which the VDI was generated.
 * [windowDimensions] The display resolution for which the VDI was generated.
 * [nw] Parameter from BigDataViewer which defines voxel length in world space.
