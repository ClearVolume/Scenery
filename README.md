# scenery  // flexible scenegraphing and rendering for scientific visualisation

## Synopsis

scenery is a scenegraphing and rendering library. It allows you to quickly create high-quality 3D visualisations based on mesh data. Currently, scenery contains an OpenGL 4-based [Deferred Shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Shading) renderer that also supports [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) and an experimental [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) renderer. Software rendering is planned for the future.

## Examples

* have a look in the [src/test/kotlin/scenery/examples](./src/test/kotlin/scenery/tests/examples) directory, there you'll find plenty of examples how to use _scenery_ in Kotlin
* Java examples are coming soon.

## Building

- Create a base directory named e.g. `my_scenery_base`. Into this directory, clone the Git repository of scenery.

- Into the same directory, clone the 2.0 version of ClearGLâ€™s Git repository: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ClearVolume/ClearGL.git
```

- in both the `ClearGL` and the `scenery` directory, run `mvn clean install` to build and install both packages into your local Maven repository
